# Array Search Program in Java

## Description
This is a simple Java program that allows users to input an array and search for a specific element. The program asks for the array's size and elements, and then performs a search operation to check if a particular item exists in the array.

- The user will first input the array size and elements.
- The program will then prompt for an item to search.
- It uses a basic linear search algorithm to check if the item is in the array.
- If the item is found, the index is printed; otherwise, a message indicating "Item not found" is shown.

## Features
- Handles basic input/output.
- Performs a linear search on the array.
- Error handling for invalid or zero-sized arrays.
- Clear and concise feedback on search results.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the Java file.
2. Compile and run the `ArrySearch.java` file using a Java compiler.
3. Enter the array size, elements, and the item you want to search for when prompted.

Example:
```bash
Enter Array Size: 5
Enter your elements: 10 20 30 40 50
Enter the number you want to search: 30
Output
Element found at index: 2
